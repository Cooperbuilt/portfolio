	        <p><h2>K-D Tree Construction</h2>
The purpose of this assigned project was to create a symbol table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points similar to a red/black Binary Search Tree. We use a
2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all the points contained in a query rectangle) and k-nearest neighbor search
(find k points that are closest to a query point).</br> </br>

<strong>Problem Prompt:</strong> (2d-tree Implementation) Write a mutable data type KdTreePointST that uses a 2d-tree to implement the above
symbol table API. A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in
the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence, starting with the x-coordinates.</br></br>
• Search and insert. The algorithms for search and insert are similar to those for BSTs, but at the root we use the
x-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller x-coordinate than the point at the root, go left; otherwise go
right); then at the next level, we use the y-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller y-coordinate than the
point in the node, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level the x-coordinate, and so forth.</br></br>
• Level-order traversal. The points() method should return the points in level-order: first the root, then all children of
the root (from left/bottom to right/top), then all grandchildren of the root (from left to right), and so forth. The
level-order traversal of the 2d-tree above is (0.7, 0.2), (0.5, 0.4), (0.9, 0.6), (0.2, 0.3), (0.4, 0.7).
The prime advantage of a 2d-tree over a BST is that it supports efficient implementation of range search, nearest neighbor,
and k-nearest neighbor search. Each node corresponds to an axis-aligned rectangle, which encloses all of the points in its
subtree. The root corresponds to the infinitely large square from [(−∞, −∞), (+∞, +∞)]; the left and right children of the
root correspond to the two rectangles split by the x-coordinate of the point at the root; and so forth.</br></br>
• Range search. To find all points contained in a given query rectangle, start at the root and recursively search for points
in both subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the query rectangle does not intersect the rectangle corresponding
to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). That is, you should search a subtree only if it might
contain a point contained in the query rectangle.</br></br>
• Nearest neighbor search. To find a closest point to a given query point, start at the root and recursively search in both
subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the closest point discovered so far is closer than the distance between the
query point and the rectangle corresponding to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). That is,
you should search a node only if it might contain a point that is closer than the best one found so far. The effectiveness
of the pruning rule depends on quickly finding a nearby point. To do this, organize your recursive method so that when
there are two possible subtrees to go down, you choose first the subtree that is on the same side of the splitting line as
the query point; the closest point found while exploring the first subtree may enable pruning of the second subtree.</br></br>
• k-nearest neighbor search. Use the technique from kd-tree nearest neighbor search described above.

	        <p><h2>Seam Carving Images</h2>
In this assignment you will create a data type called SeamCarver that resizes a W -by-H image using the seam-carving technique.
Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width)
at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row;
a horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column. Below left is the
iconic 298-by-298 pixel image of a Mandrill; below right is the image after removing 50 vertical and horizontal seams. Unlike
standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), seam carving preserves the most interesting
features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. This requires solving 3 problems.
</br></br>
<strong>Problem 1.</strong> <em>(Energy Calculation)</em> The first step is to implement the energy() method to calculate the energy of a pixel,
which is a measure of its importance — the higher the energy, the less likely that the pixel will be included as part of a
seam (as you will see in the next problem). To compute the energy of a pixel, use the dual-gradient energy function. The
energy of pixel (x, y) is ∆ 2 x (x, y) + ∆ 2 y (x, y), where the square of the x-gradient ∆ 2 x (x, y) = R x 2 (x, y) + G 2 x (x, y) + B x 2 (x, y),
and where the central differences R x (x, y), G x (x, y), and B x (x, y) are the absolute value in differences of red, green, and blue
components between pixel (x + 1, y) and pixel (x − 1, y). The square of the y-gradient ∆ 2 y (x, y) is defined in an analogous manner. To handle pixels on the borders of the image, calculate energy by defining the leftmost and rightmost columns as
adjacent and the topmost and bottommost rows as adjacent. For example, to compute the energy of a pixel (0, y) in the
leftmost column, use its right neighbor (1, y) and its “left” neighbor (W − 1, y).
</br></br>
<strong>Problem 2.</strong> <em>(Seam Identification)</em> The next step is to implement findVerticalSeam() to find a vertical seam of minimum total
energy — implementing findHorizontalSeam() to find a horizontal seam is analogous. This is similar to the classic shortest
path problem in an edge-weighted digraph, but there are three important differences:
• The weights are on the vertices instead of the edges.
• The goal is to find the shortest path from any of the W pixels in the top row to any of the W pixels in the bottom row.
• The digraph is acyclic, where there is a downward edge from pixel (x, y) to pixels (x−1, y+1), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y+1),
assuming that the coordinates are in the prescribed ranges.
Seams cannot wrap around the image (e.g., a vertical seam cannot cross from the leftmost column of the image to the
rightmost column).
</br></br>
<strong>Problem 3.</strong> <em>(Seam Removal )</em> The final step is to implement removeVerticalSeam() to remove from the image all of the pixels
along the vertical seam — implementing removeHorizontalSeam() to remove from the image all of the pixels along the horizontal
seam is analogous.
The client RemoveSeams takes as command-line arguments the name of an image and the number of vertical and horizontal
minimum-energy seams to remove, removes those seams from the image, and prints the pixel energies of the resized image.

	    	<p><h2>Enhanced Version of Binary Search</h2>
	    	This binary search program was a part of a larger assignment to make a java-based auto-complete client for class. I chose to include just this portion of the client because I felt I found an elegant solution. 
	    	</br></br>
	    		<strong>Problem Prompt</strong> <em>(Binary Search Deluxe)</em> When binary searching a sorted array that contains more than one key equal to the
search key, the client may want to know the index of either the first or the last such key. Accordingly, implement a library
of static methods BinarySearchDeluxe.java with the following API:
method
static <Key> int firstIndexOf(Key[] a, Key key, Comparator<Key> comparator)
static <Key> int lastIndexOf(Key[] a, Key key, Comparator<Key> comparator)
description
the index of the first key
in a[] that equals the search key,
or -1 if no such key
the index of the last key
in a[] that equals the search key,
or -1 if no such key
</br></br>
<strong>Corner cases.</strong> Each static method should throw a java.lang.NullPointerException if any of its arguments is null . You should
assume that the argument array is in sorted order (with respect to the supplied comparator).
Performance requirements. The firstIndexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods should make at most 1 + log N compares in the
worst case, where N is the length of the array. In this context, a compare is one call to comparator.compare() .
