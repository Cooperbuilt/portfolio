	        The purpose of this program is to create a symbol table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points. We’ll use a
2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all the points contained in a query rectangle) and k-nearest neighbor search
(find k points that are closest to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical
objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.

Problem 2. (2d-tree Implementation) Write a mutable data type KdTreePointST that uses a 2d-tree to implement the above
symbol table API. A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in
the nodes, using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence, starting with the x-coordinates.
• Search and insert. The algorithms for search and insert are similar to those for BSTs, but at the root we use the
x-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller x-coordinate than the point at the root, go left; otherwise go
right); then at the next level, we use the y-coordinate (if the point to be inserted has a smaller y-coordinate than the
point in the node, go left; otherwise go right); then at the next level the x-coordinate, and so forth.
• Level-order traversal. The points() method should return the points in level-order: first the root, then all children of
the root (from left/bottom to right/top), then all grandchildren of the root (from left to right), and so forth. The
level-order traversal of the 2d-tree above is (0.7, 0.2), (0.5, 0.4), (0.9, 0.6), (0.2, 0.3), (0.4, 0.7).
The prime advantage of a 2d-tree over a BST is that it supports efficient implementation of range search, nearest neighbor,
and k-nearest neighbor search. Each node corresponds to an axis-aligned rectangle, which encloses all of the points in its
subtree. The root corresponds to the infinitely large square from [(−∞, −∞), (+∞, +∞)]; the left and right children of the
root correspond to the two rectangles split by the x-coordinate of the point at the root; and so forth.
• Range search. To find all points contained in a given query rectangle, start at the root and recursively search for points
in both subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the query rectangle does not intersect the rectangle corresponding
to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). That is, you should search a subtree only if it might
contain a point contained in the query rectangle.
• Nearest neighbor search. To find a closest point to a given query point, start at the root and recursively search in both
subtrees using the following pruning rule: if the closest point discovered so far is closer than the distance between the
query point and the rectangle corresponding to a node, there is no need to explore that node (or its subtrees). That is,
you should search a node only if it might contain a point that is closer than the best one found so far. The effectiveness
of the pruning rule depends on quickly finding a nearby point. To do this, organize your recursive method so that when
there are two possible subtrees to go down, you choose first the subtree that is on the same side of the splitting line as
the query point; the closest point found while exploring the first subtree may enable pruning of the second subtree.
• k-nearest neighbor search. Use the technique from kd-tree nearest neighbor search described above.

	           Problem 1 (Energy Calculation):
Energy calculation is a method within Seam Carver that takes a pixel position 
given in Integers for x and y, and returns an integer representing that pixel's
energy value. A pixel's energy value is determined by change in colors across 
the given pixel's adjacent pixels. More specifically, you calculate the 
squared difference in RGB values from the north and south pixel, then add 
that to the squared difference in RGB values for the east to west pixels with
edge cases to handle border pixels. 

To solve this problem I ended up creating two helper methods that calculate 
the north/south delta and east/west delta in order to provide more compact
code. I did not have any issues with this problem, as it was simply 
implementing a given formula. The interesting part was finding a dynamic way
to change which x and y values were chosen for the border case pixels. I think
I found an elegant solution, but I will leave that up to your judgement. 

   Problem 2 (Seam Identification):
Seam identification takes an image object and returns an array of integers
representing the position of pixels in a directed line that represent the 
lowest "shortest path" from one side of the image to the other. The 
shortest path is found by determining the pixels that add up to the lowest 
overall energy total. Both horizontal and vertical seams can be identified.
I focused on writing the vertical seam, and just transposed the picture when 
horizontal seams were needed in order to write less code.

This problem took some serious consideration to solve in a clean way. In the
beginning I was doing edge relaxation within the seam finding method, but this 
resulted in very long and confusing blocks of code. Eventually, I created a 
separate edge relaxation method that I could call to within the seam finder 
which compares adjacent pixels, find the lowest energy path, then documents
which pixel represents that lowest energy path for the seam finder to access. 

   Problem 3 (Seam Removal):
Seam removal takes an image object and an integer list of pixel positions
representing the lowest energy seem and outputs a new image with the seam
removed. 

This problem took some tinkering to solve, but was not inherently difficult.
Sometimes you don't know exactly what you need from a problem, but this one 
was clear cut so it made it easier. In the end, we had to produce a new image 
that was one pixel smaller. To get there, I tinkered with for loops until I 
had a method that copies the original image's pixels to the new image up until
it hits the seam pixel at that row, then it jumps that pixel and continues
copying until it reaches the full width. This focuses on removing vertical 
seams, however removing horizontal seams is a trivial abstraction. All you need
to do is transpose the image, call vertical seam remove, than transpose it back.

	    		Problem 2. (Binary Search Deluxe) When binary searching a sorted array that contains more than one key equal to the
search key, the client may want to know the index of either the first or the last such key. Accordingly, implement a library
of static methods BinarySearchDeluxe.java with the following API:
method
static <Key> int firstIndexOf(Key[] a, Key key, Comparator<Key> comparator)
static <Key> int lastIndexOf(Key[] a, Key key, Comparator<Key> comparator)
description
the index of the first key
in a[] that equals the search key,
or -1 if no such key
the index of the last key
in a[] that equals the search key,
or -1 if no such key
Corner cases. Each static method should throw a java.lang.NullPointerException if any of its arguments is null . You should
assume that the argument array is in sorted order (with respect to the supplied comparator).
Performance requirements. The firstIndexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods should make at most 1 + log N compares in the
worst case, where N is the length of the array. In this context, a compare is one call to comparator.compare() .
