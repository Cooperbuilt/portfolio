			        		<h2>Background</h2>
			        		<p>Albatross Creative Collective is an idea born out of work my partner and I do for a Country Club media company.
			        		After seeing a need in the Country Club space for media services, we decided to move in by
			        		targeting upscale country clubs with a wide range of brand and media services.
			        		</p>
			        		<h2>My Role</h2>
			        		<p>I mocked and coded the site from scratch. The site is simple, but our target demo ranges from 50-65, so complex design and interfaces would be ill-advised.</p>
			        		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			        		<p>The main challenge on this project was the speed. This site went from concept to creation to hosting in 3 weeks in an attempt start selling clubs before winter 2016.</p>

			        		</p>
			        		<h2>My Role</h2>
			        		<p>
			        			I had a small part in the design of the site (credit Matt MacNeil). I also created and coded the scrolling site animations. My main project was the development and testing of the interactive particle logo.
			        		</p>
			        		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			        		<p>
			        			Learning new technology - html5 canvas and particle "physics". <br>
			        			Specific challenge: adapting mouse position after a window has been resized. Solution: re-calculating mouse position dynamically on a timed function to account for window changes.

			        		<h2>The Story</h2>
			        		<p>When I got back from the Army in 2014 it was very difficult to shift gears. After working as a security guard and feeling very unfulfilled, My sister and I decided to start a company together.
			        		The idea was simple, personal training and health coaching live, over web-cam. With my background in fitness and my sister's background as a health coach, we felt we could pull it off. </br>
			        		We immediately ran into countless hurdles. Together we sourced help from the SBDC, SCORE, and personal mentors to build a viable business plan. We put all the money we had into a developer and started concepting. </br>
			        		Later in the process we applied for and were granted legal assistance from the Harvard Transactional Law Clinic. It was through them that major legal concerns arose in regards to our classification of independant contractors during the period of our first revenue.</br>
			        		After 2 years, countless hours, and everyting we had as a team, we shut it down due to longevity concerns and well-funded competitors emerging in the marketplace (We mostly blame Oprah and you can ask me why). </br>
			        		However, despite the business closing, it was a pivotal time in my life. Because of our endless troubles trying to shoe-string a working platform, I was motivated to learn web development. When the business ended, I decided to pursue Computer Science as a scholastic option. My CS career then began on Khan Academy with 4th grade arithmetic, but that's another story.</br>
			        		</p>
			        		<h2>My Role</h2>
			        		<p>Co-developed and ran the business. I learned everything on the fly to be able to handle the day to day operations including bookkeeping, human-resources practices, Massachusetts employee law, interviewing techinques, and more. </p>

			        		<h2>Background</h2>
			        		<p>
			        		  I took Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in the fall of 2016. The class used Java to learn about, construct, and utilize everything from priority queues to hash tables. As the final approached, I wanted to make something that would help my peers and I succeed (a group of us were together through over a year of programming classes). <br>
			        		  I settled on a timed practice exam. Research shows active practice aids retention better than passive learning techniques. Using Professor Iyer's study materials as questions, I created the quiz with html, css, and javascript. <br>

			        		</p>
			        		<h2>My Role</h2>
			        		<p>
			        		  I Built and hosted the site. The backend for the quiz is vanilla javascript and could be optimized. Answers are stored in an array and checked in linear order. The timer function auto-submits answers when the timer hits 0:00.
			        		</p>
			        		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			        		<p>
			        		  After relying on jQuery, writing vanilla javascript was a challenge. There are still some bugs that I will be returning to in the future.
