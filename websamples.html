			        		<p>Albatross Creative Collective is an idea born out of work my partner and I do for a Country Club media company.
			        		We consistently watch this media company bring in large margins on content we create and decided to maneuver into the marketplace.
			        		We decided to target upscale country clubs, leveraging a collective of creative professionals to offer a plethora of services.
			        		</p>
			        		<h2>My Role</h2>
			        		<p>I concepted, mocked, and coded the site from scratch. The site is simple, but our target demo ranges from 50-65, so complex design and interfaces would be ill-advised.</p>
			        		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			        		<p>The main challenge on this project was the speed. This site went from concept to creation to hosting in 3 weeks in an attempt start selling clubs before the winter.</p>
